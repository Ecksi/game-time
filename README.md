This is our re-creation of the classic 1982 arcade game (later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System) BurgerTime.

The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods.

When the game's main protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, the player's character, walks the length of an ingredient (bun, meat patty, tomato, etc.), it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.
